<H2>Agricultural App </H2>

Continuing my exploration of COT reports using Streamlit, I decided to take a better look at the activity of major players in the agricultural sector published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at the end of each week.

**Commitment of Traders** reports are a set of data that are released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on a weekly basis. The reports provide a breakdown of the open positions held by different groups of traders in a variety of futures markets, including commodities, currencies, and Treasury bonds. The groups of traders include commercial hedgers, non-commercial speculators, and small traders. Commercial hedgers are typically large companies or institutions that use futures contracts to hedge against price fluctuations in the underlying physical commodity or financial instrument. Non-commercial speculators are traders who are not using futures contracts for hedging, but rather for speculative purposes. COT reports provide a snapshot of the market sentiment and can be used to help traders identify potential trading opportunities and market trends.
